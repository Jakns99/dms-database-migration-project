# Database Migration Project
This project showcases an advanced lab demo of migrating a simple web application (Wordpress) from an on-premises environment into AWS using the AWS Database Migration Service (DMS). The on-premises environment consists of a virtual web server and a MariaDB database server, both simulated using EC2 servers. The target environment in AWS consists of an EC2 web server and an RDS managed SQL database. This hands-on project provides valuable insights into the process of database migration using AWS DMS and demonstrates the practical application of AWS services in managing and migrating databases. The experience gathered from this project highlights essential concepts and skills necessary for handling database migration taks in real-world scenarios.
