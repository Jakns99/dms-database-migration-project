# Database Migration Project
This project showcases an advanced lab demo of migrating a simple web application (Wordpress) from an on-premises environment into AWS using the AWS Database Migration Service (DMS). The on-premises environment consists of a virtual web server and a MariaDB database server, both simulated using EC2 servers. The target environment in AWS consists of an EC2 web server and an RDS managed SQL database, there is an included VPC for practice in networking. 

This hands-on project provides valuable insights into the process of database migration using AWS DMS and demonstrates the practical application of AWS services in managing and migrating databases. The experience gathered from this project highlights essential concepts and skills necessary for handling database migration taks in real-world scenarios.
## Disclaimer/Project Reference
This project is not mine nor is it my idea. This project was completed with the instructions from https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs, specifically the aws-dms-database-migration lab. This project was done as a learning experience and I take no credit from the source. With that being said, I added my own explanations to why each section and technology were used and how they all fit together to showcase what I've learned.
